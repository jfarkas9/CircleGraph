CircleGraph
  Just a simple circle graph using Processing. I played around with Processing after finally completing a book I've 
  had about Processing for years. I was picturing turning this into a clock, and might come back to it later. 
  I'm also using this as a project to learn git. With this push, I believe I am finally comfortable using git. 

Getting Started
  Need to have the Processing IDE installed. 
  Either double click the file to launch into Processing, or open it from the Processing IDE.
